# SciLifeLab Research Data Management Guidelines
This is the repository for SciLifelab Research Data Management (RDM) guidelines, a central resource to provide information about data management.

## Background and motivation

* There is an information and competence gap regarding data management in the Swedish life science community

* Currently many sources of information regarding research data management exists:
  * NBIS web
  * SciLifeLab web
  * SciLifeLab Data Guidelines 
  * etc

There is a need to make a unified set of guidelines that can then be used as a resource and reference for the life science community and also for other web pages/sites/content

Information can be unified and kept up do date by the team and the community if it there is only one set of guidelines and not multiple sources as well as clear and easy ways of contributing, e.g. Github.

## Project goals
* Create the authoritative set of Research data management (RDM) best practice guidelines for Swedish life science, hosted at data.scilifelab.se (to ensure that unified information is conveyed to all recipients), including information about human data

* A single point of entry web portal/resource for national use and to connect to other efforts, eg. Training, RDMkit
