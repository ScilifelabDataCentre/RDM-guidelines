# SciLifeLab Research Data Management Guidelines
This is the repository for SciLifelab Research Data Management (RDM) guidelines, a central resource to provide information about data management.

## Background and motivation

* There is an information and competence gap regarding data management in the Swedish life science community

* SciLifeLab and NBIS had many sources of information regarding research data management 

* There is a need to make a unified set of guidelines that can then be used as a resource and reference for the life science community  in Sweden.

* Information can be unified and kept up do date by the team and the community if there is only one set of guidelines, and not multiple sources, as well as clear and easy ways of contributing.

## Purpose
* Create the authoritative set of Research data management (RDM) best practice guidelines for life science research in Sweden, hosted by SciLifeLab Data Centre and listed as a service at the data platform [data.scilifelab.se](https://data.scilifelab.se/) (to ensure that unified information is conveyed to all recipients), including information about human data

* A single point of entry web portal/resource for national use and to connect to other efforts, eg. Training, RDMkit
