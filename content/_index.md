Research data management (RDM) concerns the organisation, storage, preservation, and sharing of data that is collected or analysed during a research project. Proper planning and management of research data will make project management easier and more efficient while projects are being performed. It also facilitates sharing and allows others to validate as well as reuse the data.

The purpose of these guidelines is to serve as an information resource to life science researchers in Sweden regarding research data management.
