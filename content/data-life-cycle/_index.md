## Research data life cycle phases

The research data life cycle can be divided into several phases as seen in the wheel below; **plan, collect, process, analyse, perserve, share** and **reuse**. Here you can find information about all of these seven phases. Click on a section of the wheel below to get an introduction to that phase of the research data life cycle. Each phase have information on relevant resources and training material listed. Note that some of the phases have data type specific information while others have more general information. Data type specific information is currently avaliable for **genomics data, imaging data, metabolomics data** and **proteomics data**.
