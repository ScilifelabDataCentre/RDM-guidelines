# Analysing
During this phase the collected data, both the re-used data and the data created for this project, is explored. Things to consider are where to do the analysis, how to transfer the data, who is going to do the analysis, and how the steps of the analysis are going to be documented. Implement a good strategy on data organisation, see e.g. *'<a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424" target="_blank">A Quick Guide to Organizing Computational Biology Projects</a>'* for advice. If working with sensitive data, there might be a need for extra security measures as well as ensuring that all necessary agreements are in place.

Facilities which offer data analysis services:
* NBIS (National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden) offers bioinformatic support in various forms for a wide range of areas including NGS, proteomics, metabolomics and biostatistics.<br/><br/><a class="link-teal" href="https://nbis.se/get-support" target="_blank"><b>Learn more about NBIS support <i class="bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i></b></a><br/><br/>

* BioImage Informatics Facility provides support and education in image analysis in order to help users get started with their own analysis.<br/><br/><a class="link-teal" href="https://www.scilifelab.se/facilities/bioimage-informatics/" target="_blank"><b>Learn more about the BioImage Informatics Facility <i class="bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i></b></a><br/><br/>

## Computational resources
The <a href="https://www.naiss.se" target="_blank">National Academic Infrastructure for SuperÂ­computing in Sweden (NAISS) </a>is a national research infrastructure offering large scale high performance computing resources that can be used for analysis. In addition, many universities have their own compute resources avaliable for their researchers to use. Contact your university to learn what computational resources they offer.
