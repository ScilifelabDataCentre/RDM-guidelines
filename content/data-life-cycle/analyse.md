# Analysing
During this phase the collected data, both the re-used data and the data created for this project, is explored. Things to consider is where to do the analysis, how to [transfer the data](/topics/data-transfer), who is going to do the analysis, and how the steps of the analysis is going to be documented. Implement a good strategy on data organisation, see e.g. *'[A Quick Guide to Organizing Computational Biology Projects](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424)'* for advice. If working with sensitive data, there might be a need for extra security measures as well as ensuring that all necessary agreements are in place.

Facilities which offer data analysis services:
* [NBIS support](https://nbis.se/support) (National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden) offers bioinformatic support in various forms for a wide range of areas including NGS, proteomics, metabolomics and biostatistics.
* [BioImage Informatics Facility](https://www.scilifelab.se/facilities/bioimage-informatics/) provides support and education in image analysis in order to help users get started with their own analysis.

Facilities offering computational resources:
* [NAISS](https://www.naiss.se/) (National Academic Infrastructure for SuperÂ­computing in Sweden) national research infrastructure makes available large scale high performance computing resources. [Apply](https://supr.naiss.se/round/compute/) for Small, Medium, Large or Sensitive data allocation, depending on size and type of project.
