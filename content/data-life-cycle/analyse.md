# Analysing
During this phase the collected data, both the re-used data and the data created for this project, is explored. Things to consider is where to do the analysis, who is going to do it, and how the steps of the analysis is going to be documented. If working with sensitive data, there might be a need for extra security measures as well as ensuring that all necessary agreements are in place.

Facilities which offer data analysis services:
* [NBIS support](https://nbis.se/support) (National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden) offers bioinformatic support in various forms for a wide range of areas including NGS, proteomics, metabolomics and biostatistics.
* [BioImage Informatics Facility](https://www.scilifelab.se/facilities/bioimage-informatics/) provides support and education in image analysis in order to help users get started with their own analysis.

Facilities offering computational resources:
* [SNIC](https://www.snic.se/) (Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing) national research infrastructure makes available large scale high performance computing resources. [Apply](https://www.snic.se/allocations/compute/) for Small, Medium, Large or Sensitive data allocation, depending on size and type of project.
