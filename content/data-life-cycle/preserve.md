# Preserve
After the project is finished, the data needs to be stored in a backed-up fashion at least for 10 years, and for as long as the data is of scientific value. After this time, some of the data should be archived and some can be disposed. It is best to contact your university for information about the procedures for this.

It is important to ensure that the data to be preserved for the future is FAIR in a long-term perspective, e.g. that the data is well organised and documented, and that file formats are standard and open source rather than proprietary ones that might not be readable in the future.

## Storage
The National Academic Infrastructure for Supercomputing in Sweden (NAISS) offers storage for small and medium-sized datasets. In the future also large-sized storage will be offered. SciLifeLab offers storage resources to support data-driven life science, they are collectively referred to as SciLifeLab FAIR Storage.
