# Processing
It is during this phase that the data is prepared for analysis. This includes steps such as format conversion (ensure that the format is suitable for analysis), quality check and cleaning of low quality data, filtering data from larger datasets (so that only the data needed is kept), and combining datasets (ensure that they are compatible). For reusability purposes, it is important that all steps during the processing of data are documented.
