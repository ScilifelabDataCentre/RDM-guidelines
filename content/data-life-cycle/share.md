# Sharing
In the era of [FAIR](/topics/fair-principles) (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) and [Open science](https://www.vr.se/english/mandates/open-science/open-access-to-research-data.html), datasets should be made available to the public. Whenever possible, discipline-specific repositories (with or without controlled access) should be used in order to increase the FAIRness of your research outputs. If no such repository is available, there are general purpose repositories.

## Finding a suitable repository type

&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Does your data contain personal or sensitive information that cannot be fully anonymised?**

There may be cases where openly sharing data is not feasible due to ethical or confidentiality considerations. Depending on what the ethical board approving your study said about data sharing, and the level of permission granted from participants, it may still be possible to make your data accessible to authenticated users via a controlled-access repository.

<a href="/topics/sharing-human-data"><b>See more guidelines on sharing human data <i class="bi bi-arrow-right-square-fill"></i></b></a>

**Is there a discipline specific repository for your dataset?**

Research data differs greatly across disciplines. Discipline-specific repositories offer specialist domain knowledge and curation expertise for particular data types. Using a discipline-specific repository makes your data visible to others in your community.

**Does your institutional repository accept data?**

Many institutions offer support to their employees for managing and depositing data. Institutional repositories that accept datasets provide stewardship, helping to ensure that your dataset is preserved and accessible.

**Answered no on all questions above?**

General data repositories accept datasets regardless of discipline or institution. These repositories support a wide variety of file types and are particularly useful where a discipline-specific repository does not exist.

## Recommended discipline-specific repositories

There are several repositories for life science data types, a selection hosted by [EMBL- EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/) is found below.

  The <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena">European Nucleotide Archive</a> hosts an instance of the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), the same archive that exists on NCBI. SRA accepts raw sequence data from any sequencing platform, generated in any research project. There are several ways to <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit">submit</a> data to ENA, for more information see the <a href="https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">documentation</a>. NBIS provides <a href="https://github.com/NBISweden/data-submission-documentation/tree/main/ENA">examples of submissions to ENA</a>, including <a href="https://github.com/NBISweden/data-submission-documentation/tree/main/ENA/SOP">standard operating procedures</a> (SOPs). We also recommend the following two specialised guidelines:
  <ul>
  <li><a href="https://biodiversitydata-se.github.io/mol-data/index.html">Guide for submission of metabarcoding data to ENA</a> provided by the Swedish Biodiversity Data Infrastructure (<a href="https://biodiversitydata.se/">SBDI</a>)</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.pathogens.se/support_services/tutorial_ena/tutorial_ena_intro/">Tutorial for SARS-CoV-2 genome data submission to ENA</a> provided by the <a href="https://www.pathogens.se/">Swedish Pathogens Portal</a></li>
  </ul>

  For convenience, we have created templates for the most frequent data types and their corresponding <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/checklists">ENA checklists</a>. The templates come with instructions on how to do an interactive submission, via the ENA Webin Portal, but even when doing a programmatic submission, the template can be useful for collecting all necessary descriptions / metadata.  Download an appropriate template, and fill in the sheets according to the instructions in the template:

### Other data

Guidance on where to publish COVID-19 and Pandemic Preparedness research data, can be found on the <a href="https://pathogens.se/share-data/">Swedish Pathogens Portal</a>.

For other domain-specific repositories, see e.g. <a href="https://elixir-europe.org/services/tag/elixir-deposition-databases">ELIXIR Deposition databases</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/sdata/policies/repositories">Scientific Data recommended repositories</a>, <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/submission/">EBI archive wizard</a> (help to find the right repository depending on data type), or <a href="https://fairsharing.org/databases/">FAIRsharing</a> (the latter can also assist in finding metadata standards suitable for describing your datasets).

For datasets that do not fit into domain-specific repositories, use a general repository e.g. <a href="https://www.scilifelab.se/data/repository/">SciLifeLab Data Repository</a>, <a href="https://figshare.com/">Figshare</a> and <a href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a>.

  The <a href="https://www.scilifelab.se/data/repository/">SciLifeLab Data Repository</a>, powered by Figshare and supported by SciLifeLab and the Knut and Alice Wallenberg foundation through the Data-Driven Life Science (DDLS) program, is a repository for publishing any kind of research-related data, e.g. documents, figures, or presentations. Figshare is an open data repository used by researchers in numerous disciplines. Through an agreement with Figshare, SciLifeLab offers researchers and units the opportunity to upload and publish their research data through a dedicated portal.

  <a href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a> is a general-purpose repository operated by CERN. It can be used for sharing basically any kind of data, but also for just describing data stored elsewhere. Zenodo doesn't enforce standardised descriptions of data, so datasets described there might be more difficult to find than those described in the two repositories mentioned above.

## How can SciLifeLab help you sharing data?

If you are a researcher at a Swedish academic institution working in the life sciences, you can get help from SciLifeLab Data Management support team. This support team can help you describe and deposit your data. Here are a few examples of the support that is offered:

* Plan data submission
* Identify suitable repositories
* Assist during the submission process when publishing data and code
* Assist in the creation of metadata records in SciLifeLab Data Repository
* Advice on what needs to be done when working with sensitive human data
* Advice on describing data with proper metadata

If you need any help connected to data submission, please [contact us](../../contact/)!
