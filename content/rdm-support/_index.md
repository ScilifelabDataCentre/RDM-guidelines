Data is one of the most valuable outputs of research. Good Research Data Management (RDM) is key to ensure data reuse, and to maximise the value of research for the community. RDM concerns the organisation, storage, preservation, and sharing of data that is collected or analysed during a research project. Proper planning and management of research data will make project management easier and more efficient while projects are being performed. It also facilitates sharing and allows others to validate and reuse data.
<br><br>
SciLifeLab Data Management Support offers tools, guidance, training and hands-on support to anyone involved in life science research that is affiliated with a Swedish university or research institute.
We support various RDM aspects, such as publishing data in repositories, sharing data and code, writing data management plans (DMPs), guidance on working with sensitive human data, guidance on implementing the FAIR principles and adhere to Open Science and much more.

  <h3><b>Need a Data Management Plan?</b></h3><br>
  <p class="card-text">It is good research practice to take care of your research data and document the
  strategies for doing so in a Data Management Plan (DMP). SciLifeLab offers a DMP tool for life science data called <a style="color:black" href="https://dsw.scilifelab.se">Data Stewardship Wizard</a>.
  <br><br></p>
  <h3><b>Looking for training to cultivate skills?</b></h3><br>
  <p class="card-text">NBIS offers <a style="color:black" href="https://nbis.se/training">training and workshops</a> on research data management and reproducibility as well as bioinformatics.
  <br><br></p>
  <h3><b>Want expert advice or hands-on support?</b></h3><br>
  <p class="card-text">We offer consultations and support on all aspects of data management to researchers and research infrastructures in Swedish life science research. Contact our team via email or the contact form below for expert advise on setting up DMPs, sharing data, choosing repositories etc.
  <br><br></p>
  <h3><b>Wish to publish data in a repository?</b></h3><br>
  <p class="card-text">We can guide you in finding suitable domain-specific repositories for publishing
  your data. SciLifeLab Data Centre also maintains the <a style="color:black" href="https://figshare.scilifelab.se">SciLifeLab Data Repository</a>, data that can not be deposited in a domain specific repository can be published here. It is also possible to publish metadata for data you cannot share openly.</p>
