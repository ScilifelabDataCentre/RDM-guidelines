SciLifeLab Data Management Support offers tools, guidance, training and hands-on support to anyone involved in life science research that is affiliated with a Swedish university or research institute.
We support various RDM aspects, such as publishing data in repositories, sharing data and code, writing data management plans (DMPs), guidance on working with sensitive human data, guidance on implementing the FAIR principles and adhering to Open Science and much more.

  <p class="card-text">It is good research practice to take care of your research data and document the
  strategies for doing so in a Data Management Plan (DMP). SciLifeLab offers a DMP tool for life science data called Data Stewardship Wizard.

  <h3><b>Want to publish data in a repository?</b></h3><br>
  <p class="card-text">We can guide you in finding suitable discipline-specific repositories for publishing
  your data. SciLifeLab Data Centre also maintains the SciLifeLab Data Repository, where data that can not be deposited in a discipline-specific repository can be published. It is also possible to publish metadata for data you cannot share openly.<br></p>
