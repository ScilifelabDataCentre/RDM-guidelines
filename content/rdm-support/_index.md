  <h3><b>Need a Data Management Plan?</b></h3><br>
  <p class="card-text">It is good research practice to take care of your research data and document the
  strategies for doing so in a Data Management Plan (DMP). SciLifeLab offers a DMP tool for life science data called <a style="color:black" href="https://dsw.scilifelab.se">Data Stewardship Wizard</a>.
  <br><br></p>
  <h3><b>Looking for training to cultivate skills?</b></h3><br>
  <p class="card-text">NBIS offers <a style="color:black" href="https://nbis.se/training">training and workshops</a> on research data management and reproducibility as well as bioinformatics.
  <br><br></p>

  <h3><b>Want to publish data in a repository?</b></h3><br>
  <p class="card-text">We can guide you in finding suitable domain-specific repositories for publishing
  your data. SciLifeLab Data Centre also maintains the <a style="color:black" href="https://figshare.scilifelab.se">SciLifeLab Data Repository</a>, where data that can not be deposited in a domain specific repository can be published. It is also possible to publish metadata for data you cannot share openly.</p>
