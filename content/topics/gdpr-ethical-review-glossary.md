-   https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/

1.  **consent** (*In Swedish:* samtycke)  
  The data subject has consented to the personal data processing. Such consent is valid only if the data subject has been given adequate information about the research before consenting to it ("informed consent"). Their consent must always be documented. [Article 4 (11)](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/).

2.  **contract** (*In Swedish:* avtal med den registrerade)  
  The data subject has a contract or is to enter into a contract with the data controller.

3.  **legal obligation** (*In Swedish:* rättslig förpliktelse)  
  There are laws and rules that oblige the data controller to process certain personal data in its activities.

4.  **protection of vital interests** (*In Swedish:* skydda grundläggande intressen)  
  The data controller must process personal data in order to protect a data subject who cannot give their consent, for example if they are unconscious.

5.  **public interest** (*In Swedish:* myndighetsutövning och uppgifter av allmänt intresse)  
  The data controller must process personal data in order to carry out its duties as an authority or to carry out a task in the public interest. [Article 6](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/).

6.  **legitimate interests** (*In Swedish:* intresseavvägning; ibland "berättigat intresse")  
  The data controller may process personal data without the data subject's consent if the data controller's interests outweigh those of the data subject and if the processing is necessary for the purpose in question. Note that Swedish authorities are not allowed to use legitimate interests as a legal basis for processing of personal data in order to carry out their tasks. The reason for this exception is that Swedish authorities are only allowed to process personal data in accordance with Swedish law.

### **personal data**

The GDPR strengthens these rights compared with the Swedish Personal Data Act. In certain cases, data subjects have the right to have their data rectified, erased or blocked. They can also receive their personal data or transfer them to another controller.
