# GDPR - legal reference

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
  This section is an attempt to describe the reasoning behind the <a style="color:black"href="/topics/research-involving-human-data">guidelines regarding working with human data</a> in more detail by referring to relevant sections of the <b>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</b>, the EU-wide legislation that stipulates how personal data should be handled.
  <br><br>
  Note that this information is our understanding of the legislation, and does not constitute legal advice in individal cases. Please consult the legal office of your university if you need assistance.

## Roles

The entity who decides on why and how personal data should be processed is called [Controller](/topics/gdpr-ethical-review-glossary/#controller). In an academic research context, this is the university that employs the PI(s) responsible for the research project. All employees of a university are obliged to process personal data according to the GDPR.

A Controller can decide to use another entity to help process the data. That entity is called a [Processor](/topics/gdpr-ethical-review-glossary/#processor). The Controller must instruct the Processor how the data is to be processed in a legaly binding contract called a [data processing agreement](/topics/gdpr-ethical-review-glossary/#data-processing-agreement-dpa), and the Processor must be able to show that they adhere to the GDPR when processing data on behalf of the Controller.

## Sensitive personal data

Processing of [sensitive personal data](/topics/gdpr-ethical-review-glossary/#sensitive-personal-data) is only allowed during certain circumstances outlined in [Article 9](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-9-gdpr/), among them that the data subject has given explicit consent, or for reasons of substantial public interest. It can be noted that EU member states can introduce further conditions, including limitations, with regard to the processing of genetic data, biometric data or data concerning health. *Currently, no such further conditions have been suggested for Sweden.*

Human DNA or RNA sequence data is sensitive personal data, as it is [genetic data](/topics/gdpr-ethical-review-glossary/#genetic-data). This is probably to be considered true in most cases even if the sequence data is not accompanied with any other data, as it will be a factor “specific to the […] genetic […] identity of that natural person” ([Article 4 (1)](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/)). Aggregated data (like population frequencies) might not be considered sensitive anymore, but a decision has to be made on a case-to-case basis.

## Pseudonymised data

Even if the data is only referred to by an identifier that is not associated with the individual, and the researchers processing the data are not themselves in possession of the key of how the identifier relates to the individual, the data is still personal data, as the person can be [identified indirectly](/topics/gdpr-ethical-review-glossary/#personal-data). In this case the data is said to be [pseudonymised](/topics/gdpr-ethical-review-glossary/#pseudonymisation-of-personal-data). Data should be processed in pseudonymised form whenever possible, meaning that no directly identifiable information about the research subjects is included in the data and metadata.

## GDPR Principles

Central to the GDPR are the [Principles relating to processing of personal data - Article 5](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/). According to these principles, to process personal data, the Controller must:

* Identify the **legal basis** for data processing *before it starts*
* Inform in a transparent and honest way
* Decide the **purpose** and stick to it
* Only collect data that is needed
* Not collect more data than necessary
* Not use data for another incompatible purpose
* Erase data when no longer needed (there might be exemptions to this for research data)
* Ensure that data is correct and updated
* Protect collected data – confidential and intact

And be able to **demonstrate** that the GDPR is followed.

There are two [legal bases](/topics/gdpr-ethical-review-glossary/#lawful-gound-legal-basis) that could be applicable for processing sensitive personal data for research purposes: **public interest** and **consent**. In Sweden, public interest seems to be considered the most appropriate when processing personal data for research purposes at universities.

It is important that all personnel that process the data are aware of the purpose for which the data has been consented, to not unintentionally use it for any incompatible purpose.

A researcher processing personal data should therefore have defined the **legal basis** and the **purpose** for processing that data, and what (and only what) data is needed to perform the purpose. Furthermore, to have defined what procedures are to be used to ensure that data is correct and protected. The [security measures](/topics/gdpr-ethical-review-glossary/#security-of-processing) taken should be based on an evaluation of the risks for, and consequences of, the personal data not being correct and protected. Appropriate technical and organisational measures shall be implemented to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. It is advisable that the researcher seek guidance from the legal and information security functions of the university adminstration about this.
