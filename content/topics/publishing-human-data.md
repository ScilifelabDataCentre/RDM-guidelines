# Sharing human data

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
  <B><I>Disclaimer!</I></B> The PI, as well as everyone with access to sensitive personal data, is responsible for following current laws and regulations, and SciLifeLab will not assume legal responsibility for advice provided in these guidelines.

<!-- Generella riktlinjer för publicering av human data. Vilka olika nivåer finns.  
The recommendations on publishing human data varies depending on the nature of the human data in question. The principle "As open as possible, as closed as necessary" is of great importance when it comes to publishing human data. -->

## Sharing non-personal data

If your data cannot be linked to a living person, there is nothing in GDPR that prohibits you from sharing the data publicly. Data may however be sensitive under other regulations, so make sure that you take all relevant legal aspects into account. If you are dealing with human data, you should of course also think about the ethical and societal implications of sharing the data.

There are many repositories for sharing human-related data publicly. Here are a few examples:

European Nucleotide Archive (ENA)
: The [European Nucleotide Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) is a public repository for nucleotide sequences hosted by the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI).

ArrayExpress
: [ArrayExpress](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress) is a repository for functional genomics data hosted by the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI). 

SciLifeLab Data Repository
: The [SciLifeLab Data Repository](https://figshare.scilifelab.se) is a an institutional repository hosted by SciLifeLab for depositing and describing data related to life science research. It is particularily useful for sharing files that are not suited for domain specific repositories.

## How can SciLifeLab help you to publish your human data?
<!-- Uppdateras.  -->

**Who can get help?** If you are a researcher at a Swedish academic institution working in SciLifeLab’s areas of activity, you can get help from SciLifeLab Data Management support team.

**What kind of data publishing can we support?** If your data is located on the Bianca server at UPPMAX (or in the future at FEGA Sweden), we can help with the publishing and access requests! If your data is located in your own safe environment, we can not help with the handling of access requests but the to-do steps listed below are still valid.

Until FEGA Sweden is ready for both storing and sharing data, currently data can only be shared with PIs that can get a project account set up on Bianca.

<!-- Uppdateras av Markus FEGA  -->

This is what you need to do:
1. Adjust the Data Access Agreement and Data Access request forms (available from datacentre@scilifelab.se) to suit your particular case.
2. Store your data in your own project account on Bianca at UPPMAX.
3. Prepare a metadata record for the dataset in the SciLifeLab Data Repository. o	It is important to not upload the human data, but do provide as much descriptive metadata as possible to improve the findability. Set datacentre@scilifelab.se as “access request email” and your own email address as “contact email”.
4. In the manuscript add a section on Data Availability and make sure it includes information on where to go for requesting access to the data. The section in the manuscript can include eg. : “The data is deposited on a secure Swedish server and has been assigned a DOI (XXX). Data access requests may be submitted to the Science for Life Laboratory Data Centre through the DOI link.”
5. When a user applies for access to datacentre@scilifelab.se, the application will be vetted and you will be contacted by us. Then you can make a decision on access approved or denied. Ideally, you can (should) delegate this decision to an independent Data Access Committee (DAC).
6. When a user has been approved for access, Data Centre will document the processing and arrange for the physical file access. Until FEGA Sweden is up and running, the physical file access will be that you, as a PI, copies the dataset from your Bianca project space, to the specified project space of the approved applicant. Because of SNIC user policy, only PIs at a Swedish academic institution can have a project at Bianca. So to share data with a collaborator outside Sweden, the PI in Sweden needs to have applied for a project at Bianca. Please see [here](https://www.uppmax.uu.se/support/user-guides/bianca-user-guide/) for information on how to do this.
7. Data Centre will keep track of current and expired approvals.
