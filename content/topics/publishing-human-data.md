# Sharing human data

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
  <B><I>Disclaimer!</I></B> The PI, as well as everyone with access to sensitive personal data, is responsible for following current laws and regulations, and SciLifeLab will not assume legal responsibility for advice provided in these guidelines.

<!-- Generella riktlinjer för publicering av human data. Vilka olika nivåer finns.  
The recommendations on publishing human data varies depending on the nature of the human data in question. The principle "As open as possible, as closed as necessary" is of great importance when it comes to publishing human data. -->

## Sharing non-personal data

If your data cannot be linked to a living person, there is nothing in GDPR that prohibits you from sharing the data publicly. Data may however be sensitive under other regulations, so make sure that you take all relevant legal aspects into account. If you are dealing with human data, you should of course also think about the ethical and societal implications of sharing the data.

There are many repositories for sharing human-related data publicly. Here are a few examples:

European Nucleotide Archive (ENA)
: The [European Nucleotide Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) is a public repository for nucleotide sequences hosted by the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI).

ArrayExpress
: [ArrayExpress](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress) is a repository for functional genomics data hosted by the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI). 

SciLifeLab Data Repository
: The [SciLifeLab Data Repository](https://figshare.scilifelab.se) is a an institutional repository hosted by SciLifeLab for depositing and describing data related to life science research. It is particularily useful for sharing files that are not suited for domain specific repositories.

Learn more about [data sharing and repositories](../../data-life-cycle/share/).


## Sharing personal data

Data that need to be protected from unauthorised access may be deposited in a *controlled access repository*. In these repositories will access typically only be granted after a formal application procedure. When submitting any personal data for archiving and sharing in a controlled access repository, you must be sure that you have the legal right to upload the data to the repository.

Here are two repositories for sharing and archiving data under controlled access:

European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA)
: [European Genome-phenome Archive](https://ega-archive.org) is a service for sharing personally identifiable genetic and phenotypic data resulting from biomedical research projects. The repository is hosted by the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) and the Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG). Any data submitted to the repository is subject to controlled access, which means that access to the data only will be granted after a formal application procedure.

FEGA Sweden
: [FEGA Sweden](https://fega.nbis.se/) is repository for storing and sharing personal identifiable genetic and phenotypic data in Sweden in a way that meets the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It is part of a federation of national nodes, [Federated European Genome-phenome Archive](https://ega-archive.org/federated), which is tightly connected to the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA). FEGA Sweden is not yet operational, but researchers may express their interest in depositing data to the repository by filling in [a web form](https://nbis.se/support/supportform/index.php#sdaform).

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
<b>Do you plan to submit data to FEGA Sweden?</b> While waiting for the repository to become operational, you may want to create a metadata record in SciLifeLab Data Repository (see below). This will give you a DOI to put in your research article. Once your data has been released in FEGA Sweden, our data management support team will help you update your metadata record with apropriate information.
</div>


## If data cannot be deposited in a repository

It is not always possible to deposit personally identifiable data in a controlled access repository. In that case, one should register a *metadata record* for the data. This record will serve multiple purposes: First, it will enable unambiguous identification of the data. Second, it will provide a description of the data so that others can understand what the data is about. Third, the metadata record may contain instructions on how to get access to the data.

Here are a few repositories where you can register metadata records:

SciLifeLab Data Repository
: The [SciLifeLab Data Repository](https://figshare.scilifelab.se) is a an institutional repository hosted by SciLifeLab for depositing and describing  data related to life science research. This repository is an instance of FigShare, which means that every record will get a unique DOI. You can read more in the [repository's guidelines](https://www.scilifelab.se/data/repository).

BioStudies
: The [BioStudies database](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/) contains descriptions of biological studies. This repository is especially suited for linking a study to datasets in different repositories, but can also be used to describe sensitive data that has not been uploaded to a repository. BiosStudies is hosted by the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI).

Zenodo
: [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) is a general-purpose repository operated by CERN. It can be used for sharing basically any kind of data, but also for just describing data stored elsewhere. Zenodo doesn't enforce standardised descriptions of data, so datasets described there might be more difficult to find than those described in the two repositories mentioned above.
