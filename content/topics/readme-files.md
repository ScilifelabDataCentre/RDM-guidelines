# README files
In general, a README file is a text file written in an open format such as text format (.txt) and is not meant to be machine-actionable. The targetgroup for the README file is potential users of your data, including yourself and your research collaborators. It is good practice to create a first version of the README file at the start of a new project. The file should then be updated as the project progresses.


## Content of a README file
The content could either be on project-level or data-level. Templates for README files on the two levels can be found below.

* [Project-level README file template](/files/template-project-level-README.txt)
* [Data-level README file template](/files/template-data-level-README.txt)

## Manifest files
A manifest file can function as a complement to a README file and should contain a list of all files that are part of the project the READMe file covers. Just as the README file, a manifest file is generally a text file written in an open format such as text format (.txt) and is not meant to be machine-actionable. The targetgroup for the manifest is the same as for the README file, potential users of your data, including yourself and your research collaborators.
