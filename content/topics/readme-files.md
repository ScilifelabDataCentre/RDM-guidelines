# README files
In general, a README file contains information regarding the structure and contents of a project or a research output (e.g data and code), and it should always be located in the top folder of the files it describes. Typically, a README file is a plain text file written in an open format such as text format (.txt). A README file can also be written using the markup language Markdown (.md). The target audience for the README file is potential users of your research output, including yourself and your research collaborators. It is good practice to create a first version of the README file at the start of a new project, and then update it as the project progresses.


## Content of a README file
The content could either be on a higher project-level or on a more detailed level. Templates for README files can be found below.

<div>
  <ul>
    <li>Project README templates: <a href="/files/template-project-README.txt">txt</a>, <a href="/files/template-project-README.md">md</a></li>
    <li>Data README templates: <a href="/files/template-data-README.txt">txt</a>, <a href="/files/template-data-README.md"> md</a></li>
    <li>Code README templates: <a href="/files/template-code-README.txt">txt</a>, <a href="/files/template-code-README.md">md</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>

## Manifest files
A manifest file can function as a complement to a README file and could contain a list of all files that are part of the project the README file covers. In general, a manifest file is a plain text file written in an open format such as text format (.txt). The target audience for the manifest is the same as for the README file, i.e. potential users of your research output, including yourself and your research collaborators.
