# What is Research Data Management?

Research Data Management (RDM) concerns the organisation, storage, preservation, and sharing of data that is collected and analysed during a research project. Proper planning and management of research data will make project management easier and more efficient while projects are being performed. It also facilitates sharing and allows others to validate as well as reuse the data.

Research data is a core component of any research project or publication. Good data management practices are important in all aspects of research:

* Ethics and legislation – obligations to data owners / subjects
* Information security – mitigate risk data loss / unauthorized access
* Research documentation – consistency and reproducibility
* Project organisation – find/use the correct versions of data / workflows

Research data needs to be secured beyond the project’s time frame.

## What is a Data Steward?

Data steward is an emerging profession, developed from the need and requirement of complying to the FAIR principles and Open Science. The tasks of a data steward varies depending on the position, often defined as one of the three roles: policy, research and infrastructure. A policy data steward focuses on developing and implementing policies of research data management practices within an organisation. A research data steward works closely with the researchers, enabling them to adhere to the policies in their daily work, e.g. by giving guidance regarding data management planning, provide training, assist with publishing data. An infrastructure data steward works closely with service prociders within an organisation, such as IT department, ensuring that the infrastructure needs of the researchers are met.
