# Planning 
During this phase you plan for which data is needed to answer your research question, and how that data is going to be managed during as well as after the project.

High quality science is often only possible if the resource facilities you intend to use gets involved already in the planning phase of a project. Consultation and advice regarding data management planning, data generation and data analysis are offered by [NBIS](https://nbis.se) and [SciLifeLab](https://scilifelab.se). 

It is wise to write a data management plan (DMP), using either a tool provided by your university or [DS wizard](http://dsw.scilifelab.se/). The main benefits of writing a DMP are to collect how the data is managed and identify possible gaps in the current data management practices. Think of the DMP as a checklist to go through when planning for a new project.

Also, some resources have specific application periods and thus needs to be contacted well in advance. If your project includes sensitive (human) data, note that there are ethical and legal issues that you have to consider, such as apply for an ethics approval, establish necessary agreements and report the data processing to your [Data Protection Officer](./data-protection-officer.md). See the page on [Sensitive data](./sensitive-data.md) for more information.
