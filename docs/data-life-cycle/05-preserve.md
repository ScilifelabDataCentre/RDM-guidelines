<!-- About/intro to the phase, including link to RDMkit -->

After the project is finished, the data needs to be stored in a backed-up fashion at least for 10 years, and for as long as the data is of scientific value. After this time, some of the data should be archived and some can be disposed. It is best to contact your [university](/docs/topic/research-data-office.md) for information about the procedures for this.

[SNIC](https://www.snic.se/allocations/storage/) offers storage for small and medium-sized datasets. In the future also large-sized storage will be offered.
