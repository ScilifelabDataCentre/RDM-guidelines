# Welcome to SciLifeLab Research Data Management Guidelines!

[SciLifeLab](https://scilifelab.se/) is committed to the principles of [FAIR](/docs/fair-principles) (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) research data, i.e. that data should be easily accessed, understood, exchanged and reused. We work actively to ensure that the investments done by the society in research infrastructure resources can achieve the highest possible impact.

Research data management (RDM) concerns the organization, storage, preservation, and sharing of data that is collected or analysed during a research project. Proper planning and management of research data will make project management easier and more efficient while projects are being performed. It also facilitates sharing and allows others to validate as well as reuse the data.

<!-- bla, bla, how the pages are structured with data life cycle pages, where there is background information on what to consider during the phase, which infrastructures are available, available training etc. There are also pages which go into detail about specific topics -->

The purpose of these guidelines is to serve as an information resource to researchers regarding research data management. Click on any of the life cycle pages for guidance on good data management practices during the data life cycle, including available infrastructures. There is also overarching guidance, applicable to all data life cycle phases, on e.g. metadata standards and managing sensitive data, available as topics.

## Data Life Cycle pages
<!-- We do not (currently) have pages which cover all RDMkit phases, should we? Or, should we have our own cycle definition (and picture) where link to RDMkit Reuse could be in Collect page, and RDMkit Process could be in Analyse page? -->
* [Plan](/docs/01-plan)
* [Collect](/docs/02-collect) 
* [Analyse](/docs/03-analyse)
* [Preserve](/docs/04-preserve)
* [Share](/docs/05-share)

## Topic pages
* [FAIR principles](/docs/fair-principles)
* [Policies](/docs/policies)

### Human data pages
<!-- I imagine that we might want to gather some of these pages into a single one, with subheadings instead? -->
* [Human data](/docs/sensitive-data)
* [Human data legal references](/docs/human-data-legal-ref)
