PRJEB79726	FS42595433	Alectoris graeca PacBio HiFi WGS data	pr_106 PacBio HiFi WGS	WGS	GENOMIC	size fractionation	SINGLE	The HiFi library was constructed using the “Preparing whole genome and metagenome libraries using SMRTbell prep kit 3.0” (PN 102-166-600 (April 2022)) from PacBio. DNA was sheared on a Megaruptor 3 (Diagenode) instrument to a target size of 15-20 kb, followed by QC on a Femto Pulse instrument (Agilent). DNA repair, ligation of SMRTbell adapters, post-ligation clean-up and size selection were performed to create a sequencing library. Primer annealing and polymerase binding were performed on the library using the Revio polymerase kit (PN 102-739-100). Finally, one SMRTcell 25M was sequenced on the PacBio Revio System.

Library preparation is performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (#1000000040498). Before library preparation, the quality and quantity of the samples are evaluated using either the Fragment Analyzer system (DNF-471 kit) or the TapeStation 4200 (RNA ScreenTape), both systems from Agilent Technologies.
