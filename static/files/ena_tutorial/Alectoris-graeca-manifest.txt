DESCRIPTION	'Alectoris graeca was assembled with Hifiasm (version 0.25.0-r726). Remaining haplotypic duplications were identified with purge_dups (version 1.2.5), but manually removed in the manual curation step to avoid over purging of microchromosomes. Yahs (version 1.2.2) was used to scaffold contigs and MicroFinder (version 0.1) was used to identify microchromosome genes on short contigs. The manual curation was done with PretextView (version 1.0.3) and GRIT_Rapid (git: 1a3d79a8). For the very small microchromosomes 34-38 the manual scaffolding was also guided by the contigs alignments against the T2T chicken reference assembly (GGswu). Though microchromosomes 34-38 are probably not complete due to very low sequencing coverage 3-7X and sequencing drop outs. The assembly includes mitochondrion (MT), assembled with MitoHifi (version 3.2.1).'
